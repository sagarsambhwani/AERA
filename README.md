# AERA — Agentic Evaluation & Reliability Analyzer

AERA is a deterministic evaluation framework that analyzes AI system execution traces and produces structured failure diagnostics.

This repository implements **AERA v1**, focused on:
- RunTrace-based evaluation
- Deterministic failure classification
- Auditable evaluation reports

> This project treats AI systems as software systems.

## Status
🚧 Initial implementation (v1 core)

## Scope (v1)
- Single-run evaluation
- No LLM dependencies
- JSON in / JSON out

More documentation will be added as the core stabilizes.
